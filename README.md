# National Weather Service API Builder

This project was created to make using the NWS API easier to use. During assignment 4, I chose to use this API and found it difficult to find all the codes for the weather zones, as well as their meaning, which were frequently used as parameters in the API. So, I decided to build a website that compiled all the options for me and organized them by url.

API: https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api#/default/products_query
